            <p>Chirp Whiz started off as a simple idea for bird-lovers 
                who are stuck in the city or don't have spare time. 

                Please peruse the glossary to get to know the birds on 
                our app and then quiz yourself to see how well you do at 
                identifying our birds! You can check how well you identify 
                each bird in your stats on the User page. You can also view 
                the top players in our leaderboard in the Quiz page.

            <p>If you want to see a bird that we do not have on our  
               website please let us know! It would really help if 
               you can include the name of the bird and links to audio 
               and images of it!</p>
