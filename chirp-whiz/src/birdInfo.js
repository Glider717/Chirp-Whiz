        habitat: "Evening Grosbeaks breed in mature and second-growth coniferous forests of northern North America and the Rocky Mountains, including spruce-fir, pine-oak, pinyon-juniper, and aspen forests. Less commonly, they nest in deciduous woodlands, parks, and orchards. They breed as far south as Mexico at 5,000–10,000 feet of elevation in pine and pine-oak woodlands. In winter Evening Grosbeaks live in coniferous forest and deciduous forest as well as in urban and suburban areas. When wintering in urban environments they are most abundant in small woodlots near bird feeders."

        habitat: "House Finches are familiar birds of human-created habitats including buildings, lawns, small conifers, and urban centers. In rural areas, you can also find House Finches around barns and stables. In their native range in the West, House Finches live in natural habitats including dry desert, desert grassland, chaparral, oak savannah, streamsides, and open coniferous forests at elevations below 6,000 feet."

        sound: "https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/id/htmwav/h5070so.mp3",
        habitat: "On their breeding grounds in eastern and east-central North America, you’ll most often find Baltimore Orioles high in leafy deciduous trees, but not in deep forests; they prefer open woodland, forest edge, river banks, and small groves of trees. They also forage for insects and fruits in brush and shrubbery. Baltimore Orioles have adapted well to human settlement and often feed and nest in parks, orchards, and backyards. On their winter range in Central America, Baltimore Orioles occupy open woodlands, gardens, and shade-grown coffee and cacao plantations. They frequently visit flowering trees and vines in search of fruit and nectar."

        sound:"https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/id/htmwav/h5060so.mp3",
        habitat:"Look for Orchard Orioles in open woodlands along river edges, as well as along marsh edges, lakeshores, open shrublands, and farms. In open habitats they nest in scattered trees, including large trees planted for shade. Orchard Orioles winter in thickets, tropical forest edges, plantations, shady pastures, and lightly wooded areas—at a range of elevations up to a mile or more above sea level."
